Problems: R5 to R12

R5. Describe the role of the beacon frames in 802.11.
Beacon frame is one of the management frames in IEEE 802.11 based WLANs. 
It contains all the information about the network. 
Beacon frames are transmitted periodically to announce the presence of a Wireless LAN network. Beacon frames are transmitted by the Access Point (AP) in an infrastructure BSS. 
The beacon frame contains a number of important fields: • Timestamp: this allows all devices connected to the AP to synchronize with the AP. 
• Beacon interval: this is the time interval between beacon transmissions. • SSID: Service Set Identifier. • Supported data rates • Parameter sets: This includes information about the specific signaling methods (such as frequency hopping spread spectrum, direct sequence spread spectrum, etc.). • Capability information: This signifies requirements of stations that wish to belong to the wireless LAN that the beacon represents. For example, this information may indicate that all stations must use WPA security

R6. True or false: Before an 802.11 station transmits a data frame, it must first
send an RTS frame and receive a corresponding CTS frame.
R7. Why are acknowledgments used in 802.11 but not in wired Ethernet?
R8. True or false: Ethernet and 802.11 use the same frame structure.
R9. Describe how the RTS threshold works.
R10. Suppose the IEEE 802.11 RTS and CTS frames were as long as the standard
DATA and ACK frames. Would there be any advantage to using the CTS and
RTS frames? Why or why not?
R11. Section 6.3.4 discusses 802.11 mobility, in which a wireless station moves
from one BSS to another within the same subnet. When the APs are interconnected
with a switch, an AP may need to send a frame with a spoofed MAC
address to get the switch to forward the frame properly. Why?
R12. What are the differences between a master device in a Bluetooth network and
a base station in an 802.11 network?
